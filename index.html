                <h2>Every idea <span class="idea"></span> starts with a need</h2>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                    attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                    paper
                    and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense
                    with
                    what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
                    really
                    liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                    problem.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>Your ideas will have more value</p>
                <p>By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.

                    resolve to end it.</p>
            </div>

                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
